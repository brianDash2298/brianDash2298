- 👋 Hi, I’m @brianDash2298
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Developing but more in Front End Developing and Designs and Layouts. Interested as well in interactive websites and relaxing colour themes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML5, native CSS (but I do have a little bit knowledge in BOOTSTRAPS & TAILWIND) and I'm currently on the basics level of Javascript. I do have as well a bit knowledge about Laravel. And I'm currently working on my first ever Portfolio while studying more and making simple projects for me to practice.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everyone and I'm looking for someone who could give me mentorship because I really need that.
- 📫 How to reach me: Here are my emails brianeshamaya@gmail.com / esquibal.brian02@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: I am HE/HIS
- ⚡ Fun fact: Is I can play Guitar and Piano. Lazy but love to eat. It's fun for me, but not yours.
